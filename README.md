# Used this project to learn things like:

- Riverpod: for Statemanagement

## Getting Started

Since this project uses [freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) for code generation, be sure to run the generator with the following command before attempting to build/run the application:

```
flutter pub run build_runner build
```
